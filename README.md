#home page = carousel

On the main page you can access for all other pages with the link given above. And in the main page I have made a navbar with carousel so it represent a great bunch of smartphones within slides. Mainly in this page I conferred smartphones and their costs and in the bottom of this page you can see email and subscribe buttons.

#home page = Popular products 

For the popular products i choose a bit define high-priced smartphones such as Galaxy Z Fold3 5G Hybrid, Lg G8, OnePlus 9 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro max.
